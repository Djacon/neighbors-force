# Rules of the game Neighbors force

Neighbors force is a computer strategy game in which players fight for a hexagonal field.

## Goal of the game

The goal of the game is to capture as many cells of the field as possible and destroy the opponents.

## Game field

The game field consists of hexagonal cells of different colors. Each cell has two parameters: energy and level. The energy of the cell is shown in its upper part, and the level - in the lower part. The energy determines the strength of the cell in battle, and the level - its ability to improve neighboring cells.

The cells of the players are marked in their color, no one's cells are gray. At the beginning of the game, each player gets one cell on the field.

## Course of the game

The game goes by turns. Each turn consists of two phases: attack and upgrade.

### Attack phase

In the attack phase, the player can try to capture a neighboring cell belonging to another player or no one. To do this, he selects one of his cells and directs energy to it. The more energy he spends, the more chances to capture the cell. However, the more energy the captured cell has, the harder it is to capture it. If after the attack it was not possible to capture the cell, then at that cell that was captured, the energy decreases.

The player can make several attacks per turn, as long as he has energy on his cells.

### Upgrade phase

In the upgrade phase, the player is awarded points depending on the number of cells captured by him. On these points he can improve his cells. Each next level costs more than the previous one. The improved cell increases the energy of all neighboring cells, but not its own.

The player can improve several cells per turn, as long as he has points on his account.

## End of the game

The game continues until there is one player left or until the number of turns expires.

The winner is the player who remained last alive or captured the largest territory.
